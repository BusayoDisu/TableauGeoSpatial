# Tableau GeoSpatial Visualization

# Objective:
The project involves analyzing inpatient discharges in the U.S. from 2011 to 2015 and includes two comprehensive dashboards: the Hospital Finder Dashboard and the Discharges Dashboard. These dashboards feature bubble maps, choropleth maps, bar charts, tree maps, line charts, filters, and custom calculations to visualize the following:

The total discharges in the U.S by Diagnostic Related Group (DRG)

The total discharges by body system impacted

The total discharges by state, hospital, and time of discharge

The geographic locations of the hospitals that provided medical services for a selected DRG and the average total payments upon discharge.
